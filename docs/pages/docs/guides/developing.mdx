# Developing

With Octocord, developing your bot becomes really simple.

## Dev Guild

When developing, it is recommended to register all commands as a guild command and
use global commands when deploying to production. This is because guild commands
update instantly.

You can configure the dev guild in your config, it is recommended to keep this value
in your `.env` file.

```js {3}
export const config = {
  // the id of your dev guild
  devGuildId: process.env.DEV_GUILD_ID,
};
```

## Starting Developing Mode

Make sure your `package.json` has the following scripts defined:

```json {2}
"scripts": {
  "dev": "octocord",
  "start": "octocord start",
  "build": "octocord build",
  "deploy": "octocord deploy"
},
```

You can run the following command to start developing mode:

<Tabs items={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn']}>
  <Tab>
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```sh
    pnpm dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```sh
    yarn dev
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Once started, your bot's code will be built and your commands will be registered in your
dev guild, or globally if you did not specify a `devGuildId`.

<Callout type="warning">
  All your existing commands will be overwritten!
</Callout>

Now, if you make a change within your code, Octocord will automatically rebuild your 
bot and restart it.

If you make a change within a command's `meta.js` file, Octocord will automatically
update the registered command for you.
