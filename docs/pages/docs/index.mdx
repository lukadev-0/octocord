description: Learn how to create a bot using Octocord.

import { Callout, Tabs, Tab } from "nextra-theme-docs";

# Quickstart

Octocord is a **simple, modern framework for creating Discord bots**.

If you have an existing bot which is written using Discord.js, you can incrementally
adopt Octocord.

<Callout>

This guide assumes you've already created a Discord bot in the Developer Portal.

</Callout>

To create a new bot, you can use the `create-octocord` CLI tool:

```sh
npx create-octocord@latest
```

This tool will automatically create all the files needed to get a simple bot
up and running.

## Manual Setup

You can also setup a Discord bot manually.

Create an empty directory which will contain all your bot's code.
Within this directoy, run the following command:

<Tabs items={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn']}>
  <Tab>
    ```sh
    npm init
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```sh
    pnpm init
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```sh
    yarn init
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

This will create a `package.json` in your project.
Now, we have to install `octocord` into your project.

<Tabs items={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn']}>
  <Tab>
    ```sh
    npm i octocord
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```sh
    pnpm i octocord
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```sh
    yarn add octocord
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

In your `package.json`, add the following scripts:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "octocord",
  "start": "octocord start",
  "build": "octocord build",
  "push": "octocord push"
},
```

Now, we need to configure Octocord. Create a file named `octocord.config.js`:

<Tabs items={['JS', 'TS']}>
  <Tab>
    ```js
    export const config = {
      interaction: {
        type: "gateway",
        commands: true,
      },
      gateway: {
        token: process.env.DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN,
      },
    };
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```ts
    import { OctocordConfig } from "octocord"

    export const config: OctocordConfig = {
      interaction: {
        type: "gateway",
        commands: true,
      },
      gateway: {
        token: process.env.DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN,
      },
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="info">

TypeScript is also supported for the config,
[`bundle-require`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bundle-require)
is used under the hood to load the config.

</Callout>

We also need an `.env` file to store secrets such as the bot token.
Octocord will automatically load this file, if present.

```sh
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN="<YOUR TOKEN HERE>"
```

When deploying to production, environment variables should be configured in 
your hosting provider's website or CLI.

### Adding a command

To create a command, we need to create a directoy named `src` with a directory
named `commands` in it. This can be configured within your config.

Each command is a separate directory within of your `commands` directory,
the name of this directory would be the name of your command.

Within this directory, there should be two files:

- **`meta.js`**\
  This file contains metadata such as the description, the options,
  and localizations.

- **`command.js`**\
  This file contains the code which is ran when you run the command.

Let's create a command named `hello`.
First, create a directory named `hello` inside of the `commands` directory.
Within this directory add a file named `meta.js`:

<Tabs items={['JS', 'TS']}>
  <Tab>
    ```js
    import { ApplicationCommandOptionType } from "octocord"

    export const meta = {
      description: "Say hello to anyone you like!",
      options: {
        name: {
          type: ApplicationCommandOptionType.String,
          description: "Who do you want to say hello to?",
        },
      },
    };
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```ts
    import { ApplicationCommandOptionType, CommandMeta } from "octocord"

    export const meta: CommandMeta = {
      description: "Say hello to anyone you like!",
      options: {
        name: {
          type: ApplicationCommandOptionType.String,
          description: "Who do you want to say hello to?",
        },
      },
    };
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
